This case is for a incompressible simplefoam case using kOmegaSST and 40m/s inlet velocity.

Software used for the case are

salome 9.5.0 (salome-platform.org) 

OpenFOAM-20.06 with cfMesh (openfoam.com)

the Ahmed.py creates the 3D files, properties can be adjusted here eg. the slant angle.

the renameStl.sh converts the 3D files into a joined stl file for cfmesh.

the runMeshCase.sh file shows the commands to create the mesh and prepare for running.
